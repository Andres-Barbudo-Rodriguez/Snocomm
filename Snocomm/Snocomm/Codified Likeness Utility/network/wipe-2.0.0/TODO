Things to do:

	--	write a basic test suite for pass confirmation

	--	rename directories

	--	pull the random loops out of the main pass loop

	--	make file renaming a seperate option from random passes

	--	add more support for systems w/o a random dev
		use stdin as an alternate entropy source

	--	random length incremental truncation
		to try and screw with indirect blocks

	--	getdents() support

	--	inode/directory scrambling
		randomly create new files in directory containing target(s)
		create random (dir local) hard links.

		basically, try to wipe everything in struct stat

	--	switch to a total percentage for all the files selected,
		kind of like how apt-get does it.

		something like these:

		[blah.txt: 60%] 24%

		blah.txt: 60% [24%]

		[24%] blah.txt: 60%

		probably go with the last example (or maybe the first, or
		maybe even make it optional).
